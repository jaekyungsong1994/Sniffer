# Sniffer
Software for Sniffer Project

Sniffer is a PCB with a microcontroller, broken out into multiple interfaces:
SPI
I2C
CAN
Serial
RS232
RS422
RS485

There are also other broken out pins:
GPIO
PWM
ADC
DAC

The software will have a USB based serial interface that will allow the user to send and receive messages over these various interfaces,
allowing a computer to communicate over low level protocols.
